			<p>BitiCodes is a useful trading platform that simplifies Bitcoin trading by facilitating time-consuming tasks involved in trading.</p>

			<h2 class="title text-center">How It All Started</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<p>BitiCodes is the product of several years of research and hard work of two think tanks; a team of successful Wall Street traders and two developers who share a common interest in Bitcoin trading and the promising potential of the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
					<p>After 12 years of trading the traditional financial markets, the team decided to focus on Bitcoin trading in 2015. The skills and experience they acquired as forex traders came in handy, but they soon realized that Bitcoin trading is extremely risky due to its high volatility. However, it can be very rewarding for experienced traders who have back-tested and successful Bitcoin trading strategies.</p>
					<p>The team needed to have an edge; a trading tool that would streamline all their winning strategies, help them scan the market for trading opportunities, execute buy or sell orders based on their trading style and manage all their open trades. This birthed a new relationship with their developer friends, and together, they worked tirelessly for 3 years until BitiCodes was created; a useful Bitcoin trading platform that is user-friendly and suitable for Bitcoin traders regardless of their trading experience.</p>

			<h2 class="title text-center">The Team’s Goal</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-8 offset-md-4">
					<p>Manually scanning the Bitcoin market for good setups, planning, executing, and monitoring trades in the cryptocurrency market that is highly volatile and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, can be very tiring and time-consuming, even for the best technical analysts and the most successful traders. </p>
					<p>This is why the team set out with a goal to create a Bitcoin trading platform that works with all cryptocurrency exchanges and provides a smoother trading experience for investors by streamlining some of the mundane tasks involved in Bitcoin trading. </p>
					<p>With this Bitcoin trading platform, traders will no longer have to spend a significant part of their day monitoring trades via uncertified sources. Users can now simplify the Bitcoin trading process and still be very hands-on by using the platform as a one-stop shop for executing trades and studying the market from anywhere, at any time.</p>
