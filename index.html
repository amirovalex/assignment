            <h2 class="title">What is BitiCodes</h2>
            <ul class="list-check">
              <li>
                BitiCodes is a user-friendly Bitcoin trading platform that makes
                it possible for Bitcoin traders to expedite some of the mundane
                tasks involved in Bitcoin trading for a better and more
                efficient trading experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                BitiCodes provides you with a broker who can help you find
                trades that meet your goals; all you need to do is share your
                preferences and limitations with your broker, and they will
                notify you about trading opportunities that match your goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                BitiCodes was designed to facilitate time-consuming tasks like
                scanning the Bitcoin market and monitoring trades in the
                cryptocurrency market, which is highly volatile and is open 24
                hours a day, 7 days a week.
              </li>
              <li>
                Another feature of BitiCodes is the “Demo” account, which you
                can use to make fake trades using fake money. This is a great
                way for beginners to test their skills, learn from their
                mistakes, and generally get more acquainted with the market so
                they can hopefully become better traders over time. Even if you
                have some experience in trading, you can use this feature to
                test your trading strategy and see if it works before you invest
                money that you might lose.

            <h2 class="title">The Future of Bitcoin in 2022 and Beyond</h2>
            <p>
              Government regulations have cracked down on Bitcoin activities in
              countries like Singapore and China. Additionally, the growing
              concerns about the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining have
              been a serious threat to the growth of Bitcoin in the last couple
              of years.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, during this period, the total market capitalization of
              the cryptocurrency market grew to more than $1 trillion, and over
              18,000 other cryptocurrencies have been created since Bitcoin was
              launched in 2009. Blockchain technology is gradually being adopted
              and applied in various fields such as medicine, education, supply
              chain and logistics tracking, international remittance, and the
              insurance industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the widespread adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology
              continues regardless of the crackdown and government regulations,
              it might be safe to assume that Bitcoin will thrive for many more
              years to come, and there will still be many trading opportunities
              for Bitcoin traders to hopefully maximize.

        <p>
          It is not too late to invest in Bitcoin if you are playing the long
          game and if you believe in Bitcoin as an invaluable store of value and
          its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems in the coming
          years. However, if you share the sentiment that government regulations
          and a crackdown on Bitcoin mining activities will lead to a crash in
          the cryptocurrency economy, then you might just be too late to the
          party.

          Choosing the Best Bitcoin Trading Style
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin is a high-risk crypto asset, and trading without a plan or
          style will be disastrous and might result in a loss of capital and a
          waste of time. There are no perfect or better trading styles, but
          you’ll learn about four major styles; day trading, scalping, swing
          trading, and position trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trading styles are similar but are only different due to the time
          periods the trades are held. Scalping trades are done within a few
          seconds to hours, while swing trading is done within hours to a few
          days. Position trades can be done in days or even years.
        </p>
        <p>
          To choose the trading style that works for you, there are a few
          factors you must consider. They include risk tolerance, personality,
          and goals.
        </p>
        <div class="row mt-4 mt-md-5 pt-md-4">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <div class="mb-4 mb-md-5">
              <h3 class="smalltitle">Day Trading</h3>
              <p>
                This is a lucrative trading style but might be challenging to a
                beginner if not done properly. This Bitcoin trading style
                involves buying or selling Bitcoin positions within a single
                day. The possible profit is lower than expected in other trading
                strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, day trading requires constant monitoring of market
                trends, Day traders cannot afford to be as patient as swing
                traders, and making use of trading platforms like BitiCodes
                might be beneficial.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-4 mb-md-5">
              <h3 class="smalltitle">Position Trading</h3>
              <p>
                This is the exact opposite of swing trading; it takes a longer
                time for the price to reach the profit target. A position trader
                purposely waits for a long period of time, knowing the target
                price will be worthwhile.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, there’s a big possibility of encountering a larger loss in
                this kind of trading. It can be considered a buy-and-hold
                strategy as opposed to the buy-and-sell strategy that’s
                practiced in swing trading. It’s a trading strategy that is best
                suited for patient traders.
              </p>
              <p>
                A position trader will have to be determined in order not to be
                deterred from the big price. One of the most important factors
                in this strategy is the ability to point out the entry and exit
                points in the market trend. This ability can make any loss
                experienced tolerable.

              <h3 class="smalltitle">Scalping</h3>
              <p>
                This trading style is done by going in and out of the market
                within a few hours. The target of traders here is to make
                profits out of the smallest price movements. It involves buying
                and selling crypto assets almost immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traders, also known as scalpers, need to be fast and precise
                with the timing of market entry since it can close within a few
                seconds. It’s an exciting trading style, and its risk level is
                high. To be a good scalper, a trader must not be emotional or
                overridden with sentiments.
              </p>

            <div class="mb-4 mb-md-5">
              <h3 class="smalltitle">Swing Trading</h3>
              <p>
                This trading strategy requires a lot of patience and
                determination. Time is essential in this type of trading in
                order not to miss out on potential profits, which are mostly due
                as a result of drastic market moves.

        <h3 class="title">What Trading Strategy is Better?</h3>
        <p>
          It can’t be said which is better because it depends on the trader’s
          personality, knowledge, and risk tolerance. It also depends on the
          goals the trader has in mind; for example, a trader with retirement
          plans in mind might consider position trading, while a trader with the
          goal of making a living might prefer day trading or swing trading. All
          trading strategies are useful.

                  If you are just starting out, make sure to learn as much as
                  you can about the market, analyze the information provided by
                  the platform, and research trends and fluctuations. By doing
                  so, you’ll be in a better position to devise a trading
                  strategy that suits your goal - such as grid trading styles,
                  trends &amp; trend reversals, price action, as well as the use

          How Does Bitcoin Trading Work?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin trading involves speculation of Bitcoin price movements; just
          like in the traditional trading markets. It provides an opportunity
          for traders to maximize Bitcoin’s volatility by monitoring the market
          and analyzing fluctuations as they happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are probably familiar with the popular saying that “those who fail
          to plan, plan to fail.” Well, this principle also applies to Bitcoin
          trading, and you must have a back-tested trading plan before you start
          trading Bitcoin. You can follow these steps to create a sound Bitcoin
          trading plan:

              <p>
                Scalping, day trading, position trading, and swing trading are
                the most common Bitcoin trading styles that professional traders
                use. They differ only in the duration it takes for the price to
                reach their targets. If you are a beginner, you can try all the
                trading styles until you find one that is suitable for you.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Invalidation points and stop loss limits are important risk
                management tools. A stop loss is a buy/sell order that is
                executed only when the price hits the invalidation level of
                trade. For instance, setting a stop loss order at 5% below your
                entry level for a long Bitcoin position will limit the loss to
                5% if market sentiment changes and the price goes against the
                prediction.
              </p>
              <p>
                In January 2022, the crypto market saw a cascade of liquidations
                to the tune of $343 million within 24 hours across all the
                cryptocurrency exchanges. About $122 million of this figure was
                associated with Bitcoin trading positions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you think these liquidations would have happened if Bitcoin
                traders had set stop loss orders at their invalidation levels?
                The answer is NO.

              <p>
                Like every speculative asset, Bitcoin's price can be in an
                uptrend or downtrend, or it can be in a ranging market. You can
                determine the direction of trend and trend reversal using trend
                lines, support, and resistance, market structure, EMAs, RSI,
                etc. It is often rewarding when you flow with the tide rather
                than against it. Establishing trend direction might help you
                prepare your trades.

              <h3 class="smalltitle">Monitor your trade</h3>
              <p>
                Monitoring your open Bitcoin trades is just as important as
                determining the direction of the trend and setting a stop loss.
                Monitoring your open trades will help you spot trend reversals
                quickly, so you might be able to cut your losses if the trade is
                not successful. When monitoring trades, it is also paramount for
                you to always document the progress of all your trades.
                Journaling will help you figure out what you did right and what
                you can improve upon.

                The price of Bitcoin can be very volatile, which makes it
                possible for traders to either make a profit or lose money.

              <li>
                With leverage, traders can buy or sell Bitcoin with a fraction

                The volatility of the Bitcoin market and drastic swing in prices
                increases the risk of losing all your trading capital.

                  It is strongly recommended that you have some basic
                  understanding of technical analysis of financial markets,
                  whether you trade with a platform like BitiCodes or with any
                  other. Please note that Bitcoin trading is extremely
                  unpredictable, and while it might hopefully provide some
                  opportunities for profit, it also involves a significant level
                  of risk.

            Trading can generate notable benefits; however, it also involves a
            risk of partial/full funds loss and should be considered by initial
            investors. Around 70 percent of the investors will lose money.
